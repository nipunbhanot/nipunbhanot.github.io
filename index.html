<h1>Hi,</h1>
<p>I am a Master of Science (Electrical Engineering) candidate at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in Information and Decision Systems (Data Science, Statistics, and Machine Learning). My professional interests are in Data Science, Software Development, Machine Learning, Project Management, and Information Processing. I have tailored my program at Penn to equip myself with the desired skills.
I have over a year of full-time work experience before my masterâ€™s program. I worked at Bosch as a software engineer (languages: C, Perl), where I delivered over ten projects in a year with complete ownership. Prior to that, I worked as an AI Engineer (heading the Computer Vision team) at a Canadian fintech startup and as a Research Trainee (Computer Vision) at McGill University. I worked at NIMHANS (the premier Neurosciences institute in India) on a novel research project at the intersection of Machine Learning and Neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degree in India in Electronics and Communication Engineering (minor in Signal Processing and AI). During my undergraduate program, I gained invaluable experiences from my internships at Defence Research and Development Organization, and Maruti Suzuki. 
I am highly proficient in C, C++, Python, Perl, R, and MATLAB. I have extensive research and professional experience in Software Development, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Mining, Computer Vision, Data Analysis, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Time Series Forecasting, Database Management, Embedded Systems, Project Management, Computer Networks, Information Theory, and Signal Processing.</p>
